factorized is a terraria mod that aims to be the mod for machines and automation

- remove crates so we can add a new mechanic to replace it and automated fishing isn't overpowered
- each new area needed should have a pylon
- ore bag
- herb bag
- block bag
- expandable void bag(can add pages)
- item for creating block lines
- item for filling areas
- local events for each biome
- add more cycles for variety only day and night and moon phase is boring 
after all who doesn't love getting annoyed by the blood moon happening
in the middle of building something
